# theta360Controller


This project is part of the development of web applications for surveillance of public and commercial environments through the use of 360 video cameras. This type of devices allow to obtain a video source with a total solid angle that can be used as an input (streaming) to an HTML5 application through the application of new WebGL technologies on video textures. The source suffers from distortion that must be corrected on the display surface chosen in real time, adapting the space of the texture to the projection space to minimize this defect.
